        "description": "Californians going through a divorce may be struggling to handle their day-to-day responsibilities, like getting their kids to school or performing at work. This is completely normal, but it can also be problematic if it is not handled appropriately.\nWhile it is not a great idea to discuss all of the intimate details of a divorce with coworkers, some bosses can be accommodating of individuals employees whom they know are going through a rough personal time. Employees going through a divorce should assess whether they can trust their boss or HR with the knowledge that they are going through a divorce and see if they can get a temporary reprieve on certain larger and more urgent assignments.\nIf telling someone at work about the divorce is not an option, employees should at least try to take a personal day off from work to recuperate if they begin to feel overwhelmed. It is important to take time away from work to spend either alone or with loved ones for emotional support when going through a divorce. Throwing oneself into work and becoming a workaholic is likely to backfire in the long run.\nGiven the prevalence of divorce, it is possible that coworkers who know about an employees divorce may be inclined to give unsolicited advice. Here, it is important for a newly-single employee to keep personal boundaries and to filter out unwanted advice. Keeping a healthy mindset is very important when going through a divorce, and individuals may want to explore things like therapy to help them get to a place where they can forgive their exes and move on. However, even if forgiveness can be achieved, it may still be necessary to go to the mat to battle over items of property or assets. A family law attorney can help individuals with these more difficult aspects of a separation."

        "name": "A billionaire uses trusts to hide money in his divorce",
        "description": "If you are getting divorced in California and there are assets involved, what is happening to Marie Bosarge should frighten you. The wife of a billionaire may be completely shut out of receiving her share of a very large marital estate because her husband legally moved nearly all of their assets to a state that promotes extreme secrecy and protection for the assets of the super-wealthy.\nEach divorcing couple will have a point in the process where they need to exchange information about their property and its valuation. In a divorce, this is known as the marital estate, and it is divided between the parties based on the agreement that they will reach. One of the real dangers in a divorce is that one spouse will either hide assets or deliberately undervalue them to end up with more for themselves.\nMost times, courts will have a very negative reaction to this practice. However, Ed Bosarge moved practically all of his money to South Dakota before the divorce had begun. He was obviously preparing for the divorce but had told his wife that he had the assets there to avoid paying taxes. South Dakota law did not require Ed Bosarge to inform his wife that he had switched beneficiaries of the trusts to someone other than her. Now, she is largely prevented from touching the money and has had to sue her husband because the marital estate has been reduced to $12 million.\nWhen there are assets at stake in a divorce, you need a divorce attorney on your side to make sure that you receive what you deserve in the asset division process. If your spouse is engaging in any type of questionable behavior when it comes to marital property, your attorney may fight to learn more about their assets and will follow the money trail. If they discover hidden assets, they could bring it to the attention of the judge for their action."

        "name": "Concerns for older adults in a divorce",
        "description": "Gray divorce is a phrase often used to describe divorce among older adults. Because this age group may be already retired or near retirement, they may not have years of earning income ahead of them to make up for financial losses during the divorce. As a result, it is important for California adults in this situation to be careful in the process of property division.\nGathering as much information as possible about assets and debts is a good first step. People may need to get certain assets, such as jewelry and antiques, appraised. Tax returns, prenuptial agreements and estate planning documents may be helpful at this time. Individuals who are concerned about a spouse hiding assets might want to talk to an attorney about how best to secure marital property.\nRetirement accounts, often a major asset held by older adults, must be divided according to the rules based on whether they are IRAs, 401(k)s, annuities or pensions. When considering how property should be divided, people should think about what they will need for their lifestyle after the divorce. They might want to put away money in an emergency fund or ensure that they can offer financial help to children or grandchildren. Others may want to travel the world, start a foundation or work to build a stronger community.\nCalifornia is a community property state, and this means that assets are supposed to be divided equally. However, in practice, couples negotiating an agreement for property division do not necessarily have to divide every asset 50/50. Instead, they can divide their property in a way that fits their individual situations. Their attorneys can assist in these negotiations. In addition to giving the couple control over the divorce agreement, this approach can be less stressful, expensive and time-consuming than litigation."

However, out of the recent economic chaos comes an opportunity for these spouses. Retaining the marital home has gotten slightly easier as conditions have changed. So long as it makes economic sense, spouses stand a better chance of accomplishing their goal.\nThe current economic displacement has slashed real estate prices. For most homeowners, this is a source of consternation. However, for those who need to purchase a home or part of it, this presents an opportunity because it reduces the amount of money that one spouse needs to pay the other. In addition, the mortgage rates have plunged to historic lows, meaning that refinancing can drastically lower monthly payments.\nThen, a spouse needs to consider whether buying out the other spouse is an economically viable course of action. In many cases, real estate is a sound investment and owning a home is a great way to gain exposure to this asset class. However, it is also best not to concentrate all of ones financial resources in one area. Nonetheless, this is an advantageous time to purchase an interest in real estate as prices historically increase for this asset and it is on sale for a discount right now.\nKeeping the home is not always a given because the other spouse may want to remain in the home themselves. A divorce attorney could be helpful to handle negotiations with the other spouse to figure out the terms of the divorce agreement that pertains to the home. If there is no agreement, the attorney may take the matter to a hearing in court where they would seek to persuade the judge to let their client keep the home."

        "name": "Student loan debt in a California divorce",
        "description": "With nearly 45 million Americans burdened by student loan debt, there is no question that a large number of California residents take out student loans before getting married or during marriage. Given that the average age at which individuals first get divorced is 30, many divorcing couples are likely to have to have a significant amount of student debt on the table.\nIf someone incurs student debt before entering into a marriage, that debt would be the persons separate property, and the spouse would not be liable for same. One exception to this is if both spouses consolidated pre-marital student loans into one loan in both partners names. However, if someone takes out a student loan during marriage, this is not the case.\nIn equitable distribution states, a spouse is only liable for debt incurred by the other if he or she cosigned the loan. In most community property states, a student loan taken out by either party during marriage is community property, meaning that both spouses are equally responsible to repay the debt. Though California is a community property state, it does have one exception to the general rule. If a spouses name is not on a student loan taken out during a marriage, and if the couple gets a divorce within 10 years of marriage, then the non-borrower spouse will not be responsible for repaying the loan.\nWhen a couple in California gets a divorce, it can be difficult to account for and valuate all assets and debts, especially if a separate property asset increases in value due to efforts made by the spouses during marriage. A family law attorney may help clients valuate community property and assess whether certain assets and debts are separate or community property."

        "name": "Education makes a difference in divorce rates",
        "description": "You may be wondering what are some statistical patterns that would make a California divorce more or less likely. One of the common themes now present in the data is that couples with higher education levels are less likely to get divorced. This is the reverse of the situation that persisted in the early part of the last century.\nThere are several reasons why a couple with more education may be more likely to have an enduring marriage. One of the major contributing factors is that people who take time to get more education will often delay marriage until after they receive their degree. This enables them more time to grow as a person before committing to a spouse. Education also correlates to higher income levels. Many divorces result from tensions and fights over money. With more resources, there are fewer fights to be had.\nThe differences between survival rates of marriages of women who have college degrees versus those without are stark. A woman with a college degree is almost twice as likely to avoid divorce than one with a high school diploma. In general, there is a declining divorce rate which is a net positive for society. However, those who decide to get divorce must bear the same amount of strain as ever in a divorce proceeding.\nRegardless of the level of education, the actual divorce is still difficult. There are financial and other family law issues that must be settled. These issues can be even more pressing in a divorce where both spouses have a college degree because there are more assets at stake. A family law attorney may help his or her client obtain the highest share of the marital estate as possible under the circumstances by either negotiating an agreement or litigating the case if necessary."

        "description": "When California couples are going through a divorce, they may have to decide what will happen to a business in which they both have ownership interests. They may want to continue running it, or one person might want to buy out the other.\nIt can be difficult for people to keep running a business together after a divorce, but they might choose this option because they both enjoy it or because there is likely to be a large profit later. Couples in this situation should make sure they have a buy-sell provision . This helps ensure that the stock held by the minority owner does not become illiquid. In other situations, both individuals may continue as owners because one lacks the liquidity to buy out the other. If this happens, one person may continue as the manager while the other still has ownership but is not involved in operations.\nCouples in this situation might need a put/call option that allows the operator to purchase the other spouses share later. They may also want provisions that give the other person some veto rights to prevent the operator spouse from making fundamental changes to the business. If one spouse is able to buy out the other, the spouse leaving the business might want to be protected from any future claims against the business.\nIn California, a community property state, most property acquired since the marriage is considered shared property and is supposed to be split equally in a divorce. This could mean that one person can claim a significant portion of the other spouses business even if that persons involvement in the business is minimal. If one person owned a business or other property prior to the marriage, the amount of appreciation the asset has had since then may be subject to division."

        "description": "Whether a California divorce remains amicable or ends up in hostile litigation may depend in part on how the spouses treat each other while the process is unfolding. Disrespect will generally breed hostility, so spouses should make sure to be respectful while the divorce is pending.\nThe biggest aspect of respect is how the spouses speak to each other. A respectful tone can go a long way, and spouses should resist the temptation to be sharp regardless of the circumstances of the divorce. If there are children involved, the parents should be open and transparent with each other. If one parent seems like they are hiding something, it could spur the other to litigate. Further, parents should be willing to make schedule changes without much fanfare or drama.\nWhen it comes to battles, many of them are simply not worth fighting. This is especially true when it comes to fights over property division. Some things do not merit the emotional and possible financial costs of the battle. Knowing when to walk away can make the difference between whether the divorce can happen without litigation. One of the most important things that a spouse can do is apologize when they are wrong. A simple apology when it is merited may disarm a spouse who is ready to fight.\nA divorce attorney may be helpful in convincing their client what fights are unnecessary and keeping the divorce moving toward a conclusion. They might give their client a realistic assessment of the costs and benefits of a certain action so that the client will know whether it is worth it or not. The attorney may also give tips on how to ensure that the divorce does not degenerate into a never-ending and costly legal battle."

        "description": "Technology seems as if it is advancing faster and faster every day. Entrepreneurs in California are taking advantage of this fast-paced environment to found tech startups or even to invest in promising companies. This is an exciting time in the tech world, but many people are heading straight into it without taking any precautions. For example, few startup founders consider what might happen to their companies and wealth during divorce.\nWhen a tech startup makes it big, its founder may experience a gradual or even sudden increase in his or her wealth. If the individual is married, that wealth is considered community property even if the spouse had nothing to do with the business. Getting divorced wouldleave that wealth vulnerable during property division and could even compromise the stability of the startup. This is because California is a community property state, so the money and assets from the business would be split evenly between the two parties.\nHowever, some startup founders and business owners do not feel like this system is particularly fair when it comes to businesses. Simply thinking that something is not fair does not change anything, though. Using a prenuptial agreement can, though.\nSome people might find the idea of creating a prenuptial agreement pessimistic or unromantic, but entrepreneurs in Californias technology industry know just how important it is to consider as many possible outcomes for the future. Whether a founder is still in the early days of his or her startup or is planning to launch in the coming months or years, protecting the associated interests and wealth is essential. A carefully worded prenuptial agreement  or a postnuptialagreement if the parties are already married  can do just that."

        "description": "Most people in California understand what a prenuptial agreement is. Signed before getting married, these powerful family law tools can protect individuals and their personal assets should they end up divorcing. However, not everyone is familiar with postnuptial agreements or why these documents may be helpful for new parents.\nFirst, it is important to understand what a postnuptial agreement is. It is similar to a prenuptial agreement in regard to what it covers, but instead of being signed before marriage, it is signed afterwards. There are a number of reasons why a couple might choose to use a prenuptial agreement, including having children.\nPostnuptials are very helpful when it comes to establishing obligations and rights when it comes to care arrangements, finances and more. Since having a child is an already-stressful situation, addressing these types of topics early on can be helpful. A couple can also tackle tough issues like property division at a time when things are relatively good and stable. Should they ultimately decide to divorce, emotions will not get in the way of rational decision-making.\nParents are not the only people who can benefit from postnuptial agreements. A couple who wanted a prenup but did not have time to sign one before the wedding may choose a postnup instead. Or if one spouse suddenly receives a sizablesum of money  such as an inheritance  a postnup can address how those funds will be used and treated both during marriage and in the event of divorce. If a couple is not sure whether they could benefit from a postnup, speaking with an experienced California attorney may help."

        "name": "Does socioeconomic status predict divorce?",
        "description": "Common knowledge holds that marital satisfaction will start off high, only to dip over the years following the wedding. New research indicates that there may be hidden factors influencing marital satisfaction. This means that being dissatisfied in marriage might not be dependent on socioeconomic status. This status could be an unexpected predictor of satisfaction and the likelihood of divorce.\nResearchers that found a link between socioeconomic status and marital status recently published their study in a journal. This analysis largely focused on middle-class couple who were mostly white, and researchers speculated that the results might be different among different groups. They decided to refocus their research on 431 low-income couples living in California.\nFrom 2009 to 2014, the researchers contacted all of the couples five times, asking them to fill out questionnaires that measured marital satisfaction. Couples were then divided into one of three groups regarding marital satisfaction  high, moderate and low. Around 60% of couples were highly satisfied with their marriages. Couples withlow marital satisfaction only accounted for 10% of the group. Further inquiries revealed that lower socioeconomic status affected women more strongly than men, and the effect was seen most strongly in women reported lower levels of satisfaction at the beginning of marriage.\nUltimately, no two couples are alike. Each married couple in California will encounter their own obstacles and problems, which can influence how satisfied they are with their marriages. No matter why a couple decides to divorce, it is important that each person understands his or her rights when going through the process. Some find that speaking with an experienced attorney can be helpful for doing so."

        "description": "When ending a marriage, parents usually have a significant number of things on their minds. From determining child custody to working out both child and spousal support, it is easy for some important matters to slip through the cracks. Since taxes are usually not on peoples minds during the fall, California parents may overlook who gets to claim children as dependents on federal tax returns.\nBecause of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, child dependency deductions are eliminated through 2025. However, some parents can still see tax benefits from claiming children as dependents. In the case of a divorced couple, only one parent can claim a child in a given year. In general, the custodial parent  the parent with whom a child spends the majority of his or her time  is the one who gets to claim the child.\nThere are some situations in which a noncustodial parent can claim his or her child. Noncustodial parents who provide more than half of their childrens financial support could possibly do so. In addition to several other requirements, the custodial parent must also provide a written declaration that gives his or her ex the right to claim a child for that years taxes. Noncustodial parents may qualify for age-specific tax credits, higher education tax credits, student-loan interest deductions and more.\nParents should be sure to discuss who will claim a child on any given year, and under what circumstances. Some parents in California choose to alternate years and specify so in their custody agreements. This is perhaps especially in situations where they share joint custody. Since taxes are a serious annual matter, divorcing parents may want to speak with experienced attorneys before making any decisions."

        "description": "Credit scores determine much of what a person has access to. From securing an auto loan to finding reasonable housing, credit scores can either help or hinder an individual get to where he or she wants to be. For these reasons, California couples might be worried about filing for divorce. While the divorce process does not affect credit scores, actions taken during and after certainly can.\nJoint debt is fairly common in marriages. In general, debt that a couple takes on during marriage is considered marital property, which must be divided between both parties. However, even if one person is tasked with repaying a certain debt while the other is responsible for other obligations, any issues may ultimately come down to the whose name is on the debt. This means that even if an ex is responsible for repaying a loan, a creditor can still come after his or her ex-spouse for nonpayment, which affects credit scores. When possible, refinancing loans in only one persons name can be helpful.\nAnother way an individual can protect his or her credit score during divorce is to open up new lines of credit during divorce. While it might feel counterintuitive to establish and use new lines of credit during what may feel like a financially fragile time, doing so helps build and fortify a persons credit score. This is especially helpful for individuals who have little to no credit history because they did not work or their spouses took care of the household finances.\nPulling a credit report as early on in the process as possible will give individuals a baseline understanding of their credit scores. Not only is it a good idea to understand what a persons score is, but it also provides him or her the opportunity to make decisions that support financial goals. These types of proactive steps can help people in California traverse the divorce process as successfully as possible."

When the economy is going strong and incomes begin to grow, the number of divorces in California and across the rest of the country also increase.\nEven thoughmoney is one of the main contributors to marital stress, having more money does not necessarily help. A 2018 study from Northwestern Mutual found that 41% of respondents reported that financial anxiety negatively affects their relationship. As it turns out, having more money actually increases financial stress rather than alleviating it.\nIn addition to having more money to stress about, a higher income also contributes to divorce in other ways. When considering whether to file for divorce, people generally take their finances into account. Since divorce does have a financial impact, when the economy is not doing great and incomes are low, some people would rather put off filing. Once incomes go up, those who did not feel financially secure enough to pursue divorce generally feel as if they can move forward with the process.\nDeciding to file for divorce is a complicated matter, and people pursuing this option usually take a wide range of factors into consideration. Aside from their personal feelings regarding their marriage, this also means thinking about financial stability after a divorce. However, California residents who have financial concerns associated with divorce can generally reach an agreeable solution by paying careful attention to details and seeking guidance when necessary."

However, the top priority should be to create a schedule that preserves the best interests of the baby. Ideally, visits will be scheduled with the childs feeding and sleeping schedule in mind. Furthermore, visits should be no more than 30 minutes long and take place about three to four times a week.\nThis should give a noncustodial parent enough time to bond with the baby and learn how to best care for the child. Shorter visits may be an especially good idea if the mother is still breastfeeding. However, if the child is able to take a bottle, it may be possible for a noncustodial parent to have a young son or daughter overnight. If there are issues creating natural milk for the child, it may be worth supplementing it with formula.\nOvernight visits can be beneficial for a custodial parent because it will give that person an opportunity to catch up on his or her sleep. In most cases, courts will not order that overnight visitation occurs until the child is a few years old. If a custodial parent is resistant to longer visits without a court order, the noncustodial parent is urged to determine why that is and find a way to overcome it.\nIndividuals who are denied child custody rights are still generally entitled to visitation rights instead. If parents cannot negotiate a parenting plan on their own, it may be necessary to have a judge create one on their behalf.

        "description": "During a divorce, California parents usually just want what is in the best interests of their children. However, what those best interests are can be highly subjective. Long-held biases in both the general public and family law can make it difficult for fathers to continue being active parents after divorce. For some, it could even lead to a custody dispute.\nThere are currently around two million stay-at-home dads in the United States. Despite this, 14% of Americans think that opportunities for mothers to bond with babies should be prioritized over bonding opportunities for fathers. This attitude goes beyond initial bonding, as 53% of people think that mothers are just better suited for child rearing. Only 1% of adults believe that a father could do a better job at caring for a baby.\nThese biases show up during matters involving child custody. Due to a number of factors, including divorce and unmarried parents who have children together, 25% of children do not live with their fathers even some of the time. This is generally not from a lack of desire on the fathers part, but because of inherent inequalities that men face when trying to be active parents. The problem is especially difficult for unmarried fathers who may be unsure of their legal rights or how to uphold them.\nDepending on the situation, some parents are able to work out their own custody agreement outside of court, which is then signed off by a judge. When this is not possible, a child custody dispute may be unavoidable. California fathers who are ready to address their problems with either a proposed or current custody order should consider speaking with an attorney before moving forward, as doing so could provide valuable insight on their options and possible outcomes."

Things that women may have tolerated in older generations, such as adultery, are no longer considered acceptable by many wives.\nAccording to one therapist, the main reason for couples getting divorced at an older age is emotional detachment. Since people are now living well into their 80s and 90s, they may decide they do not want to spend their golden years with someone with whom they no longer have a spark. It can also become more apparent to couples that they have grown apart after their children have grown up and left the house and stopped being the focus of attention. Of course, at least a portion of the divorces occurring among older couples are those of second or third marriages, which were statistically less likely to succeed in the first place.\nThough getting divorced at an older age may mean that couples do not have to worry about things like child custody or support, they still need to determine how to separate their assets. In California, a community property state, all marital property must be split 50-50, including things like retirement assets, which can present a challenge if a portion of those assets was acquired before marriage.

        "name": "Motor vehicle accidents more likely with older models",
        "description": "In California and across the U.S., car crashes more commonly happen with vehicles that are older than 10 years. These older vehicles are often involved in fatal or preventable crashes because owners fail to do routine maintenance, according to the Ohio Highway Patrol.\nIn one study of the last three years, older vehicles were involved in the majority of vehicle defect-related crashes. According to the Ohio Highway Patrol, 56% of accidents were caused by defective equipment in vehicles with model years from 1999 to 2008. Only 24% of accidents caused by defective equipment happened in vehicles with model years from 2009 to 2018.\nThe most common causes of motor vehicle accidents were blown tires and brakes that failed. Blown tires caused 42% of fatal crashes. These accidents could have been prevented with regular vehicle maintenance.\nAccording to the Ohio Insurance Institute, the average vehicle age is 11.8 years, and that is the highest it has ever been. The average vehicle age has been steadily increasing since 2002 when the number was 9.6 years. These figures reflect the fact that drivers are keeping vehicles longer, and some vehicles can last for 15 years and go up to 300,000 miles. One of the reasons that drivers keep vehicles longer is because it is more expensive to repair and replace parts on newer vehicles. An example is a bumper that would cost $200 to repair on an older vehicle and now costs $1,000 on a newer vehicle.\nWith more older vehicles on the road today, the likelihood of being in a motor vehicle accident has increased. Car accidents can result in serious or debilitating injuries that can last a lifetime as well as cause job loss and excessive medical bills. When an individual is a victim of a motor vehicle accident, it may be important to have a personal injury lawyer to fight for just compensation."

        "name": "Crash risk higher for teens who have a peer as a passenger",
        "description": "Teenagers are inexperienced drivers and can be distracted even by other people in the car, especially when those people happen to be their friends. California parents should know that teens run a 44% higher risk for a car crash when they invite just one peer to be a passenger. This is according to research from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.\nFor this reason, experts recommend that teens keep from having any young passengers for at least six months after obtaining their license. If parents can get them to do this for the first year, then all the better.\nHowever, parents should not make an allowance for siblings. Though it can be convenient to have teens pick up and drop off their siblings in lieu of the parents, this is actually more dangerous than having a friend in the car. A younger sibling could easily get the older sibling excited or angry, which means a greater chance for inattentive driving.\nParents may want to set up restrictions when it comes to having their teens ride in a friends car. For example, if the friend is newly licensed and they intend to make a long trip, parents should give their disapproval. The possibility of night driving is another factor that parents may want to consider.\nWhen teens cause motor vehicle accidents, their auto insurance company may face a personal injury claim. Victims, for their part, need to prove the other sides negligence, and this can be hard without concrete evidence like phone records or eyewitness testimony. After all, distracted drivers can lie about their actions to the police and never be contradicted. This is just one reason why having legal representation is advisable."

        "name": "School start times may affect safety of teen drivers",
        "description": "Teenagers require 8 to 10 hours of sleep a day, and they usually need to sleep late into the day as well. What time school starts in the morning, then, can influence how much sleep teens get. This, in turn, can affect things like academic performance, mental health and, as one study suggests, safety behind the wheel. California residents should know that later school start times may lead to fewer car crashes involving teens.\nThe Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine published a study that focused on the change that Fairfax County, Virginia, made to its school start times back in the fall of 2015. Specifically, it pushed back the start times from 7:20am to 8:10am. Researchers calculated, for the year before the change and the year after it, the rate of car crashes involving licensed drivers between the age of 16 and 18. They saw the rate decline from 31.63 to 29.59 crashes per 1,000 drivers.\nIncidentally, the rest of Virginia, which did not alter school start times, saw the same steady rate of teen car crashes. Researchers noted that teens who get more sleep are less likely to drive distracted or engage in other risky behavior. The AASM has echoed these thoughts and actually recommends that middle and high schools start at 8:30am or later.\nPreventing distracted driving is so important in this period of increasing smartphone and in-vehicle technology use. It is a form of negligence, and when it is behind motor vehicle accidents, those who were injured and who contributed little or nothing to their injuries can be eligible for compensation. To learn more about how their case holds up under personal injury law, victims usually see a lawyer. A lawyer may be especially helpful when it comes to negotiating a settlement."

        "name": "Cities with the highest motor vehicle accident rates",
        "description": "Thousands of motor vehicle accidents happen in California every year. While many of these accidents are relatively minor, some cause serious injuries or deaths. Certain areas are more prone to accidents, according to a recent study.\nStudy of accident patterns\nGo Safe Labs, which is a nonprofit based in San Francisco, analyzed almost 2 million car accidents by reviewing accident reports from 2018 and 2019. Researchers then took the data by location and date to determine the 10 cities in the U.S. with the highest rates of accidents. Researchers also used latitude and longitude to determine the 10 spots with the highest risks of accidents.\nCities with the highest number of accidents\nHouston, Texas, had the highest number of accidents with 22,118 in 2019. Houston was followed by Charlotte, North Carolina, with 21,818. Los Angeles came in third with 19,660 accidents. Rounding out the top 10 cities were Austin and Dallas, Texas; Raleigh, North Carolina; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Nashville, Tennessee; and Phoenix, Arizona. Nationally, accidents increased by 6% from 2018 to 2019.\nAvoiding accidents\nOne possible reason why Los Angeles had so many motor vehicle accidents in 2019 is traffic congestion on its roads and highways. People who drive on Californias roads should exercise caution at all times and take steps to prevent accidents. They should obey the traffic laws, keep their eyes focused on the roads and avoid distracted, drunk and drowsy driving. When people are seriously injured in accidents that are caused by the actions of other motorists, they might be entitled to recover compensation by filing personal injury lawsuits.\nExperienced motor vehicle accident lawyers might review the police reports, scene photographs, medical reports and other evidence from collisions to assess the merits of potential claims. If they agree to accept the representation of a victim, the attorneys may be able to negotiate with the insurance companies for their clients to try to secure damages in amounts that fairly compensate the victims for all of the economic and non-economic losses that have been suffered."

        "name": "Multi-vehicle accidents, and how to prove fault",
        "description": "Proving negligence in a car accident can be difficult, and it becomes even more so in the case of a multi-vehicle crash. Residents of California may do well to know what the process is like, though. Negligence, first of all, is a legal concept referring to a persons failure to exercise reasonable care.\nMulti-vehicle crashes are often a series of rear-end collisions and can be caused by drivers who speed, follow too closely to the vehicle in front and commit other negligent acts. In the case of two-rear end collisions, the first driver, Driver A, might be blameless while the two behind him or her can be held to be at fault if they were negligent.\nHowever, it often turns out that the driver in the middle, Driver B, did nothing wrong and that the negligence of a Driver C caused Driver B to collide with Driver A. In that case, Driver A holds Driver C responsible. Driver B may also file a claim against Driver C.\nTo prove negligence, one will need plenty of evidence. This can include the police reports and any physical evidence at the crash site, including skid marks and vehicle debris. Eyewitness testimony, such as from passers-by or from the passengers in the cars that collided, can be helpful as well.\nWhen victims of motor vehicle accidents want to see if they are eligible for compensation under personal injury law, they usually see a lawyer for a case evaluation. This may help them decide if they should file a claim. The filing process can be complicated, but a lawyer may handle every step, especially the negotiating of a settlement out of court. A successful claim may cover victims for past and future medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering and more."

        "name": "Truckers more likely to crash with the more caffeine they use",
        "description": "High amounts of caffeine over the short term can help truckers through the day, but if this becomes a habit, it may raise the risk for an accident. One study suggests a link between high caffeine use and higher crash risk, though future studies will be needed to prove any cause-effect relationship. California drivers may nonetheless be interested to hear the results, which were published in the journal Safety Science.\nThe study involved 3,007 truck drivers from eight different states, including California. These truckers were chosen specifically because of their caffeine-using habits. On the one hand were those who consume a single cup, glass or pill of a caffeinated product every day. On the other hand were those who consume over five of them.\nAsked in a questionnaire about their health, the high caffeine users reported poorer health overall. This included poor sleep, an unhealthy diet and a habit of smoking. Researchers also asked if they were in a crash in the past three years: 27.8% of the high caffeine users said yes, which was significantly more than the first group (21.6%).\nAgain, correlation does not mean causation, but researchers are confident that the link will only become clearer with time. Future studies can focus, for example, on the tipping point where caffeine consumption leads to unsafe behavior.\nTruckers could cause motor vehicle crashes because they are drowsy, intoxicated, distracted or negligent in some other way. Victims of such negligence may be able to seek compensatory damages, but they may want to consult an attorney in advance. Personal injury attorneys usually have a network of investigators and other third parties who can bring together proof of the defendants negligence. Victims may then have their attorney negotiate on their behalf."

        "name": "Research demonstrates link between music and car accidents",
        "description": "Musicians from all walks of life and genres have immortalized the state of California in song. While music is certainly an important part of the state, it could also be making the roads more dangerous. Scientists recently demonstrated that songs with certain BPMlevels  beats per minute  influence drivers to engage in more risky behaviors while behind the wheel. This means that listening to certain types of music could actually increase the risk of car accidents.\nThe study was conducted with participants who were asked to drive on a simulated, six-lane road. Researchers had participants either listen to music or drive in silence, then observed their driving behaviors. One of the main points of data the scientists looked at was how often participants changed lanes.\nOn average, the study participants switched lanes 20 times for every 70 minutes behind the wheel. However, since this was the average number of lane changes, some groups switched much more often and others much less. The group that had the highest number of lane switches were those that listened to high-tempo music of 120 BPM or more, whoaverageddouble the average number of lane changesand drove at least 5 mph over the limit. The popular song American Idiot by Green Day was determined to be the most dangerous driving song, followed by Miley Cyrus Party in the USA and The Killers Mr. Brightside.\nMusic is an integral part of many peoples lives, but it can be dangerous. For example, if a driver chooses to focus on the music coming out of the radio instead of on the road, he or she would be putting other drivers in danger. However, in California it is possible for distracted and dangerous drivers who cause car accidents tobe held accountable for their actions. This is usually accomplished through successfully pursued personal injury claims."

        "name": "Pedestrian accidents: Tesla driver runs down couple",
        "description": "California police say that a woman in a rented car caused a recent deadly accident. One person was killed and another was injured in the pedestrian accident, and neither the responsible driver nor another involved motorists suffered any injuries. Pedestrian accidents can be particularly tragic, since victims who are traveling on foot are more vulnerable to fatal injuries than people who are traveling in enclosed motor vehicles.\nAccording to police, the 21-year-old driver had used the Getaround app to rent a Tesla. The app works much like Airbnb, and allows owners to rent out their vehicles. For reasons that are still not clear, the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed when shedrove straight through a red light and hit another vehicle. Both drivers lost control of their vehicles, and the Tesla driver ended up running down two pedestrians. The pair was a couple who were out celebrating their wedding anniversary.\nBoth the husband and wife were transported to an area hospital, where the man later died. Neither of the drivers involved in the wreck were injured, and both stayed at the scene of the accident and cooperated with investigators. Authorities have since stated that neither drugs no alcohol were factors in the crash and that the Teslas autopilot feature was not engaged at the time. California police arrested the Tesla driver and charged her with running a red light and vehicular manslaughter.\nWhen traveling by foot, pedestrians have little to no protection against large motor vehicles. Victims often suffer serious and even fatal injuries in pedestrian accidents. The extreme physical and emotional trauma of these accidents place an enormous burden on victims and families alike, not to mention the financial problems that often come with medical bills. Although undoing the harm caused by serious or fatal accidents is not possible, compensation achieved through personal injury or wrongful death claims can be beneficial for recovery, grieving and moving forward with life."

        "description": "Statistically, it is likely that you will be in at least one car accident. When this happens, the legal determination of liability is probably the last thing on your mind. However, there are certain steps that you can take in the days and weeks following a crash that will protect your legal rights and facilitate the advocacy that a personal injury attorney will eventually do on your behalf.\nFirst, we recommend calling the police after every accident, even minor ones. The reporting officer will prepare a police statement which, although generally inadmissible as hearsay in a court of law, is an important investigative resource.\nSecond, it is important to notify your insurance carrier of the accident, even if you are concerned you were partially at fault. In many policies, this is a prerequisite to seeking important benefits under your policy. However, you do not have to make speculations regarding fault during this initial call. We advise limiting your conversation to the facts outlined in the police report and consulting with an attorney. In particularly, we caution against making any recorded statements to an insurance adjuster without your attorney present.\nFinally, it is important to seek treatment for all medical symptoms you may experience after a car accident. Although it is common in our culture to shrug off minor discomforts, an attorney will need to understand the full scope of your medical condition. The cost of your medical treatment, the impact to your earning capacity, and your pain and suffering may all go toward the calculation of your damages, which is the amount of compensation you will request in a car accident lawsuit. Seeking early treatment may also prevent more serious medical complications down the road.\nSource: FindLaw, Car Accidents  FAQ, copyright 2019, Thomson Reuters"

        "name": "Wrongful death lawsuit filed after Bryant crash",
        "description": "People across the country were stunned by the California helicopter crash that took the life of basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight other people. Now, the families of four of the victims have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company that operated the helicopter flight. This follows a lawsuit that was filed by Bryants widow, Vanessa.\nThe chopper was attempting to make its way through dense fog at the time of the crash. Other flights were grounded at the time when the pilot was trying to get Bryant to his destination. The pilot is accused of carelessly flying in a manner that led the helicopter to crash into the side of a mountain, killing all of the passengers aboard the flight. The National Transportation Safety Board found that there was no engine failure on the helicopter.\nThe lawsuit is solely against the company that owned the helicopter. It does not name the pilots estate as the defendant. However, Vanessa Bryants lawsuit also names the pilot as a defendant, claiming that he should have aborted the flight due to the weather conditions.\nIsland Express stopped operations in the days following the crash. Subsequent reporting has found that the company did not have the proper certification for all of its pilots to fly in the conditions that were present at the time of the crash.\nWhen a loved one dies under circumstances like these, the families may file a wrongful death lawsuit against the person or company whose action or inaction led to their death. These lawsuits might lead to substantial financial compensation if they are successful. A wrongful death attorney may help families file the legal action to recover this compensation. The attorney might be able to prove that someone else was responsible for the death of the loved one."

        "description": "Practicing safe driving habits like removing distractions and always wearing a seat belt can potentially help reduce a persons risk of being involved in an accident. Unfortunately, being a safe driver does not address at least one issue  other drivers. A recent fatal accident on a California highway demonstrates just how difficult it is to avoid unexpected dangers on the road.\nAt approximately 5:20 a.m., a 52-year-old man somehow left his lane and struck the divider separating the two sides of the freeway. After striking the divider the car came to a stop across multiple lanes of traffic, including the fast lane. A pickup truck that had been traveling in the same direction could not stop in time to avoid a collision. The driver who initially wrecked his car suffered fatal injuries when he was thrown from the vehicle.\nSeveral other vehicles were also involved in the wreck. After the pickup truck collided with the first wrecked car, there was not enough time for a 25-year-old man on a motorcycle to maneuver out of the fast lane or slow to a stop. He hit the pickup and and was thrown off his motorcycle. This young man also died at the scene of the accident. Three other vehicles collided with the other cars after that, but the driver of the pickup truck was the only person who had to be taken to the hospital for injuries.\nA fatal accident causes so much more than just an unfortunate death. Friends and family members are left behind to handle the devastating aftermath, much of which is both emotional and financial. California families need time to grieve their losses, but are often so caught up in finding money for funeral expenses or making ends meet that doing so is simply not possible. Families can address these issues through wrongful death claims, which can still be filed even if the negligent driver also died in the accident."

Two of the fatalities were children, although it is not clear if they were related to the woman who was driving the vehicle they were in. There were two other people also involved in this fatal accident who were uninjured.\nA 34-year-old woman was driving on a California highway bridge with two children as her passengers. Around 4:45 p.m., a 55-year-old driver who was heading in the opposite directiondrifted out of his lane and into the path of the womans vehicle. The two vehicles collided, were pushed to the side of the highway and caught on fire. Surrounding vegetation also caught fire as a result of the collision, causing two acres to burn in a brush fire.\nThe woman and the two children were killed in the accident. The driver who apparently caused the wreck and a 13-year-old passenger in his vehicle did not suffer any injuries. Firefighters had to extract another passenger in his vehicle  a 28-year-old man  who suffered major injuries and had to be airlifted to an area hospital for treatment.\nThe unexpected death of a loved one is never an easy experience, but it can be extremely hard for a parent who has lost a child in a fatal accident. Burying a child is something that no parent in California should have to go through. While financial compensation could never replace the life of a lost loved one, it can certainly help address the emotional and financial damages of his or her death. Surviving family members might be able to better focus on the grieving process when they are able to handle the financial burden of things like funeral and burial expenses."

A fatal accident such as this can be extremely distressing to injury victims and loved ones who survive the fatally injured.\nPolice say that the wreck occurred at approximately 1:25 p.m. on a recent Saturday. A 54-year-old father had been driving with his three sons  two 7-year-old boys and a 16-year-old  on the freeway when his vehicle suddenly became disabled.

        "description": "An unexpected death is a complicated situation for surviving family members to handle. Families often struggle to cover funeral expenses and adjust to losses in income. These financial damages can make it difficult for families to fully process their loved ones death, and concern over money can even interrupt the grieving process. If a California family has experienced the loss of a loved one, it may be extremely important to pursue just legal recourse through a wrongful death claim.\nA person does not have to be criminally charged in order for a family to pursue a wrongful death suit, which is because criminal negligence is different than civil negligence. This means that, while that person might not have acted criminally, his or her behavior may have still been negligent. Demonstrating that negligence is not always easy though and requires identifying a number of elements, including that the surviving family members suffered financial damages as a result of their loved ones death.\nDamages from successfully pursued claims cover much more than lost wages. Pecuniary injuries may include funeral expenses, loss of prospective inheritance, lost support, services and bills incurred through attempts at life-saving medical care. However, determining the just and fair level of compensation for those pecuniary injuries in California is not as straightforward as it may seem. Factors such as a victims age, overall health, projected life expectancy, income and future earning potential play an important role in this decision.\nThe loss of a loved one can be especially difficult if he or she was killed by a person acting in a negligent manner. The period of time following that death can be complicated by more than just emotions, but also by the financial damages that can quickly affect surviving family members. Achieving necessary compensation through a wrongful death claim will not erase the emotional pain of this difficult experience, but it can ease financial worries and give a victims family the space to grieve."
